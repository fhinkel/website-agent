Demo for using browser_use with Gemma open models.

This example uses Gemma to control a Chrome browser. The code provided showcases how to:

* **Initialize a Chrome browser instance:**  Including configuring Chrome to use a specific profile.
* **Define tasks for the agent:**  Provide natural language instructions to the agent to specify the actions it should perform in the browser.
* **Utilize an LLM:**  Integrate with a large language model (in this case, OpenAI's GPT models) to interpret instructions and guide the agent's actions.
* **Execute the agent:** Run the agent and observe the results of its browser interactions.

This specific example explores retrieving information from websites like Reddit and Stack Overflow by providing natural language queries to the agent. It highlights Gemma's capability to understand complex instructions, navigate websites, extract data, and summarize findings.
